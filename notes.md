# Mastercard Cybersecurity Virtual Experience Program
**Role:** Security Awareness Analyst  
**Date:** October 2025  

## Overview
As part of Mastercardâ€™s Security Awareness Team, I supported the Chief Security Officer (CSO) by helping employees learn to identify and report cybersecurity threats.  
Phishing is one of the most common threats organizations face. It involves pretending to be someone or something trustworthy to gain information such as passwords or financial data.  
Attackers often send links or attachments designed to infect systems or trick recipients into providing sensitive information. Successful phishing attempts can cost companies millions and put employees at risk.

## Phishing Simulation Campaign
To mitigate phishing risks, Mastercard educates staff through phishing simulation campaigns.  
Each month, simulated phishing emails are sent to employees to test awareness. The results are analyzed to guide future training and awareness programs.

### Phase 1: Improving the Phishing Email
Tasked with recreating an obvious fake phishing email to make it more realistic for testing purposes.
Key improvements:
- Added context relevant to Mastercard employees
- Masked the hyperlink within text
- Used correct spelling, grammar, and tone
- Added legitimate-looking details to increase credibility

### Phase 2: Analyzing Campaign Results
Reviewed team performance based on open, click, and success rates.

| Team          | Open Rate | Click Rate | Success Rate |
|----------------|------------|-------------|---------------|
| IT             | 80%        | 2%          | 0%            |
| HR             | 100%       | 85%         | 75%           |
| Card Services  | 60%        | 50%         | 10%           |
| Reception      | 40%        | 10%         | 0%            |
| Engineering    | 70%        | 4%          | 1%            |
| Marketing      | 65%        | 40%         | 38%           |
| R&D            | 50%        | 5%          | 2%            |
| **Average**    | **66%**    | **28%**     | **18%**       |

Findings:
- HR and Marketing teams were most susceptible.
- Targeted training and reinforcement were recommended for those groups.

### Phase 3: Training and Awareness

1. What phishing is and how it works  
2. Common attacker tactics
